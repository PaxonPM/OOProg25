# OOProg25
Teaching materials for Object-Oriented Programming with C# (2025 version)

For those interested in using these materials for teaching, here is a (very brief) guide to the **Chap** folder, which is the folder containing these materials. **NB**! Be aware that the materials are not very "polished", and are available *as-is*. Maintenance of the materials is not guaranteed. Also be aware that parts of the materials are in Danish (marked for each relevant chapter).

## General

- Each folder is intended to represent a fairly coherent "module" about Object-Oriented Programming with C#.
- Each folder will typically - but not always - contain a Word document plus (up to) three sub-folders.
- The Word document contains the "textbook" for the module, including texts for exercises.
- The folder *Unsolved* contains starting points - in the form of Visual Studio solutions - for the exercises in the module.
- The folder *Solved* contains solutions - in the form of Visual Studio solutions - for the exercises in the module.
- The folder *Presentations* contains various PowerPoint presentation related to the module.
- Again, be aware that some chapters do not follow this structure.
- The materials are in general compliant with .NET 9, C# 12 and Visual Studio 2022.

## Modules (Core)

The modules are described in the order in which they are most naturally presented.

### Start
General introduction to Visual Studio 2022, tools, extensions, packages.
General introduction to code organisation, statements, syntax and interaction with Visual Studio.

### Prog01
Basic programming concepts: data types, variables, arithmetic, logic, functions, screen output and type conversion. 

### OOProg01
Basic Object-Oriented programming concepts: object and class concepts, class definition elements, class collaboration, abstraction.

### Prog02
Intermediate programming concepts: conditional statements, repetition statements, debugging, data structures, code quality and the DRY concept.

### OOProg02
Intermediate Object-Oriented programming concepts: inheritance, exceptions, generics, delegates, events and lambda expressions.

### Prog03
Intermediate programming concepts (continued): data structures, recursion, LINQ.

### OOProg03
Advanced Object-Oriented programming concepts: open/closed principle, dependency injection, design patterns.

### Prog04
Advanced programming concepts: the Task class, async/await, concurrent data access.

## Modules (Supplementary)

These modules are not as such essential, and are all fairly self-contained. Also, the structure of these modules may deviate from the standard structure outlined above.

### UnitTest
Basic unit testing in Visual Studio using *MSTest* (unit test structure, code coverage). Requires at least **OOProg01**.

### ADONet
Essentially an exercise set for using *ADO.Net*, i.e. no "textbook" material as such.  Requires **OOProg02**.

### EFCore
Essentially an exercise set for using *Entity Framework Core (version 9)*, i.e. no "textbook" material as such.  Requires **OOProg02**.

### RazorPages
Various materials about *Razor Pages* (basic pages, plus use of Entity Framework Core). **NB**: Most of these materials are in Danish. Requires **OOProg02**.

### Database
Various materials about *Databases* (design, SQL plus integration with Visual Studio 2022).

### HowTo
A set of exercises intended for repetition of selected topics (class definitions, control statements, collection classes, inheritance, generics).

### Suppl
An assorted set of supplementary exercises (see the **Oversigt**-document) covering a wide range of topics (class definitions, control statements, data structures, LINQ, design patterns, lambda expressions). **NB**: These materials are in Danish, and are not particularly polished.

### Misc
A small set of presentations on various topics (documentation, GitHub essentials and web hosting). **NB**: Most of these materials are in Danish.
